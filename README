Description
=========================

libexword is a library that implements the low-level OBEX commands
used to communicate Casio EX-word dictionaries. 

This library comes with a program called exword that uses libexword
to allow manipulation of files on the dictionary.

Features:
	* list files on device
	* upload/download files
	* delete files
	* install/remove add-on dictionaries


Commands
==========================

connect [mode] [region]
	This command connects to an attached EX-word dictionary. It
	accepts two optional parameters: the first specifies the connection
	mode, and can be either library, text, or cd. The second one is the
	region of your dictionary and is a two-letter country code.

	The default values for mode and region are library and ja.

disconnect
	This command simply disconnects from the currently connected dictionary.

model
	This command displays the raw model information about connected device.

capacity
	This command displays the capacity of the currently selected storage medium.

format
	This command will format the currently inserted SD card.

list
	This command will list all files and directories in your current directory.

delete <filename>
	This command deletes deletes the specified file from the currently set
	directory on the connected device

send <filename>
	This command will upload a file to the connected device. <filename> should
	specify the fullpath to the file on your local filesystem.

get <filename>
	This command will download a file from the connected device. <filename> should
	specifiy the fullpath on your local filesystem where the file should be saved.

setpath <path>
	This sets the current path on your dictionary. The path is set using the
	following format: <sd|mem://path>.

set <option> [value]
	This command sets various configuration options. If no value is given for the
	specified option, its current value is printed out.

		debug - This option sets the debug level (0-5)
		mkdir - This option tells setpath if it should create non-existent directories (yes|no)

	This command is used to manage installed add-on dictionaries. It only works
	when connected in library mode.

			save the username/authkey pair to users.dat file. It also deletes any
			already installed add-ons.

		auth <username> [key]
			This peforms authentication and must be called before any other subfunction
			except for list and reset. If key is not specified, it will try to find the
			username in the users.dat file.

		list [local|remote]
			This command will list all local dictionaries if local is specified or, if
			remote is specified it will list remote dictionaries. The default is remote.
